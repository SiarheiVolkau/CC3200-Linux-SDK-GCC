# CC3200-Linux-SDK

## Overview
This repo contains a reworked SDK for the CC3200 microcontroller, from Texas 
Instruments, to work under linux with GCC compiler.
The intention is to provide a fully worked SDK for GCC compiler, while TI doesn't
cover all things to be worked with GCC compiler in official SDK.

The TI SDK version used for this rework is the 1.3.0 and the original can be
found at : http://www.ti.com/tool/cc3200sdk.

For instructions on how to use it, please see [usage](USAGE.md) file.

## Changes from the original SDK
- Easy switch between R1M1 (128k SRAM) and R1M2 (256k SRAM) chips.
- Bootloader memory region now used for heap.
- Replaced all the makefiles for libs and examples.
- Issues with GCC fixed.
- Fixed all warnings generated by GCC compiler.
- All examples have work with make and cmake build systems. You can use any
  IDE which supports one of these build systems.

For a complete list of changes, see [changelog](CHANGELOG.md).

## Rebuilding the libs and examples

Open a terminal in the cc3200-sdk directory and do a ```make clean && make all```
